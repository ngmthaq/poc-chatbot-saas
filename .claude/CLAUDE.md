# WORKSPACE INSTRUCTIONS

Always read all markdown files in the sections below to get complete information about the project, do-do (DO) and don't-do (DO NOT) tasks.

---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This section will provide an overview of the project, such as the project name, description, programming language, frameworks, main libraries used, library management platform, and project documentation location - see [PROJECT_OVERVIEW](./PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md).

---

## CODING CONVENTIONS

This section will describe the programming conventions for the project. If agents need to write code, they should follow these conventions to ensure everyone understands and adheres to them - see [CODING_CONVENTIONS](./CODING_CONVENTIONS.md)

---

## AGENT RULES

This section provides information on "DO" and "DO NOT" clauses. Agents should refer to these items to prioritize tasks when receiving assignments from users or to avoid following them when receiving assignments from users - see [AGENT_RULES](./AGENT_RULES.md)

## LIVE KIT

LiveKit is a fast-evolving project. Always refer to the latest documentation. LiveKit provides an MCP server at `https://docs.livekit.io/mcp` with tools for browsing and searching docs. Key tools: `get_docs_overview`, `get_pages`, `docs_search`, `code_search`, `get_changelog`, `get_pricing_info`. Prefer browsing (`get_docs_overview`, `get_pages`) over search, and `docs_search` over `code_search`, as docs pages provide better context than raw code - see [LIVE_KIT](./LIVE_KIT.md)

## Codebase Knowledge Graph

See [GIT_NEXUS.md](./GIT_NEXUS.md) for the auto-generated codebase index produced by GitNexus, covering dependencies, call chains, clusters, and execution flows.
